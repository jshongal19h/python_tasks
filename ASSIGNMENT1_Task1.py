# ask 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations###
# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
# 1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
# 2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
# o	Addition
# o	Subtraction
# o	Multiplication
# o	Division
# 3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.###

x=int(input("Enter the First number:"))
y=int(input("Enter the Second number:"))

Addition = x + y
Subtraction = x -y
Multiplication = x * y
Division = x / y

print ("Addition:" , Addition)
print ("Subtraction:" , Subtraction)
print ("Multiplication:" , Multiplication)
print ("Division:" , Division)
